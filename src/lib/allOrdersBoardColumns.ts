// (fulfillmentBoardColumns.ts), this mixes Pickup/Manual Delivery/TumaBoda in one view, so it
// can't group by statusV2 (each mode's vocabulary is different and not comparable). Groups by
// the legacy Order.status instead — the one status value every fulfillment type shares — which
// is coarser (no "rider assigned" vs "in transit" distinction here) but that finer detail is
// still visible per-card via resolveStatusDisplay's own label, just not what buckets a card into
// a column.
