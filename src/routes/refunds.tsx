            Because most issues with custom packaging are best fixed by re-running the affected
            portion of the print job, our default remedy is a <strong>free reprint</strong> of
            the defective units, on the same artwork and stock, with priority production. Where
            a reprint isn&apos;t practical we offer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Store credit</strong> equal to the value of the affected units, usable
              against any future order within 12 months.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A monetary refund</strong> to your M-Pesa or bank account.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Direct product-for-product exchanges only apply to standard (non-printed) stock
            items — custom-printed items cannot be exchanged.
